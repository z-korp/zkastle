A fully on-chain game, with Dojo on Starknet.

## Overview

zKastle is a solo strategy card game inspired by Palm Island. In this game, you take control of a village and help it grow and flourish by strategically managing resources, and upgrading your infrastructure. Your goal is to maximize your points through tactical decisions and efficient resource management.

## Gameplay

### Turn Structure
At each turn, the player draws two cards from a deck and interacts with them.

### Card Interactions
- Storing Resources: Cards that represent resources (iron, wheat, stone) can be stored for future use.
- Upgrading Cards: Cards can be upgraded using the stored resources. Each card has 4 upgrade versions, progressively enhancing their effects and benefits to the village.
- Discarding Cards: If a card is not needed for immediate use or storage, it can be discarded.

### Card Management
When a card is used, whether for storing resources or upgrading, it is placed at the end of the deck. This recycling of cards ensures a continuous flow of options and strategic choices for the player.
